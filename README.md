## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://https://tailwindcss.com//) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned the interesting way of setting different src for Image depending on the screen size.

### Continued development

It would be nice to incorporate some functionalities that would make the product view more interesting. This can be done by giving the user a chance to interact with the product something like showing a zoomed in part of the product when the mouse hovers over this said part like in Amazon's product preview.
